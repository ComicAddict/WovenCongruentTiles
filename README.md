# gs3d_blender
 3D weaving generator written with python using the Blender API for Python. 

 Use Blender 3.5 to get a consistent visualization on the weavings.
 
 TODO: 
 - [x] Create another script such that it creates the cases for Grunbaum and Shepherd on 2D plain and twills
 - [ ] Different color combinations on the same weave group can generate different patterns, try different color scheme
 - [ ] This will result in eschers cloth patterns eventually
 - [ ] On the manufacturing side we can use different materials for different weaves to get cumulative effect on the whole material property
