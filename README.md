# gs3d_blender
 3D weaving generator written with python using the Blender API for Python. 

 Use Blender 3.5 to get a consistent visualization on the weavings.
 
 TODO: 
 - [x] Create another script such that it creates the cases for Grunbaum and Shepherd on 2D plain and twills
 - [x] Different color combinations on the same weave group can generate different patterns, try different color scheme
 - [x] A/B parametrized curve for 2D weave structure boundary
 - [x] Sweeping exploration for 2D Weave decomposition on the cube fundamental
 - [x] 3D modeling of the magnet bounded pieces
 - [x] 3D printing of the magnet bounded pieces
 - [x] 3D modeling of slotted parts
 - [x] 3D printing of slotted parts
 - [x] For decomposition figures use 3 different images side by side: Sites, boundary, decomposition itself
 - [ ] 3D modeling of the key/slot pair
 - [ ] 3D printing of the key/slot pair
 - [ ] Sweeping exploration for 3D Weave decomposition on the cube fundamental
 - [ ] On the manufacturing side we can use different materials for different weaves to get cumulative effect on the whole material property
 - [ ] unfold, unwrap of the models
 - [ ] Generalized curved structures for saddle, cylinder, dome
 - [ ] Truncated octahedron and hexagonal prism for fundamental structures
